title: Tech side of myself
---

I'm a tech enthusiast . Basically I can talk with computers in C,C++ and Python. My relationship with computers began in early 2006, that's when I learned ”How to power on a computer?”. After undergraduate, during holidays I was working for a computer sales company where I bought my first ever desktop - ”GlobalSoft Technologies”. There I have learnt assembling, disassembling and hardware compatibilities.
